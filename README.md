My very first html5 project from 2013


This is the very first personal learning project I did when I was learning HTML5. 
The code is not impressive. It uses kinetic.js and jQuery, and apparently Backbone! I honestly don't remember even knowing what Backbone was back then, but there it is!
Just open index.html and shoot those cards!
